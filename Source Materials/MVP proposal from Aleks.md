**Agent Services MVP**

**1\. Technology Stack:**  
**Frontend:**

- **Blazor (C\#)** \- core frontend framework across all projects. Must align with existing portal modules and component library.  
- **Razor Components / .NET 8** \- Used for views, data binding, and reactive forms.  
- **UI Kit** \- Reuse of existing reusable Blazor components (cards, grids, forms). Styles and layouts remain consistent with the current portal.

**Backend:**

- **C\# / .NET 8 API layer** \- Business logic, data validation, workflow, audit, and integrations.  
- **Microsoft SQL Server** \- Central relational DB for Agent, Entity Master, Licensing references, commissions, and documents metadata.  
- **Entity Framework Core** \- ORM for database communication.

**Deployment:**

- **Azure DevOps** \- Repositories, pipelines, deployments, and environment management.  
- **Hosting / Environments** \- Dev/Test/UAT/Prod \- Standard four-tier deployment model.

**Additional:**

- **Azure Active Directory (SSO \+ MFA)** \- Unified authentication provider across Plateau systems; supports 2FA and user/role sync with Microsoft 365 identities.  
- **E-Signature** \- Existing e-sign solution; integration via REST API for sending, tracking, and retrieving signed docs.  
- **Progress ShareFile** \- Default repository for master policies and signed agreements, includes built-in e-sign capability.  
- **DMZ Layer \+ Internal API Gateway** \- All agent-facing endpoints exposed via DMZ; internal communication via secure internal APIs protected by firewalls and WAF.  
- **Existing Licensing Web Module (SQL-backed)** \- To be reused or connected via internal API; only email automation is missing.  
- Internal Email Service (SMTP / Microsoft 365 API) \- Used for workflow notifications and reminders.
