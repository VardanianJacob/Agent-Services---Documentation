[**VIEW RECORDING \- 37 mins (No highlights)**](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p)

[@0:00](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=0.74) \- **Eric Shaver (Plateau Group)**

Hello, is that even Russian and Ukrainian?

[@0:06](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=6.88) \- **Brannon Smith**

Everyone?

[@0:08](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=8.98) \- **Yuliya Fortsel (Symfa)**

Hello, so Eric, are you still learning Russian or are you just in the past? That's history.

[@0:18](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=18.48) \- **Brannon Smith**

Yeah, exactly.

[@0:22](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=22.58) \- **Yuliya Fortsel (Symfa)**

So, you know Russian too, Verena, I didn't know that.

[@0:25](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=25.66) \- **Eric Shaver (Plateau Group)**

I know a few phrases.

[@0:27](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=27.62) \- **Brannon Smith**

Okay, we may start all our meetings with some new words.

[@0:32](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=32.56) \- **Yuliya Fortsel (Symfa)**

That works. Okay, hi, Michael. Hi. Okay, everyone is here. Let them start. So, we analyzed all information that we have regarding the agent services product.

Okay. And also, we tried a call with Terry to understand. And the current business flow, and try to prepare our understanding of the MVP functionality, and wanted to kind of review this with you, and maybe you will have some adjustment, clarifications, and also we have some questions, and maybe let's start with the demonstration of our vision of the MVP, and Akop, please pick this up.

Yeah, sure.

[@1:30](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=90.192) \- **Akop Vardanian**

Am I coming through okay? Can you hear me?

[@1:35](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=95.172) \- **Eric Shaver (Plateau Group)**

all right. Okay.

[@1:36](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=96.732) \- **Yuliya Fortsel (Symfa)**

Okay, good.

[@1:37](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=97.772) \- **Akop Vardanian**

So, first of all, we will go through the process overview steps. Then my colleague, Alexander, is going to introduce you with more technical details and solution.

Let me share the screen. I'm probably you can see now the diagram. The schema. Okay, yeah, thank you. So let's go from top to down.

And the first step, of course, is instead of PDF forms, in the first step with endless email back and forth, so we now have web forms with real-time validation.

Agent can fill out the form in five minutes. The system automatically validates data and fills for returning clients. So the second step, when we go to Agent Service System, the system automatically creates an agent record and validates all data, duplicate detection, required fills, document completeness.

If something's wrong, the agent gets a specific list of records. So the next step, we go to operation team, so here we are doing some commission verification, if it's handled by a separate operation team, through a web interface, course, and they verify compliance with general agent agreement and business rules.

This ensures quality control at the verification stage. Then we go to senior officer. Senior officer makes a decision only after operation team approval.

As we understand, as we understood, no random decisions, only verified and validated applications. So the next step, document, here we're just doing some automation.

After.

[@3:59](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=239.856) \- **Aleksandr Nasstrom**

After.

[@4:00](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=240.128) \- **Akop Vardanian**

For final approval from senior officer, instead of manual document preparation, the system automatically generates master policies and producer agreements with agent data.

So state-specific templates, version control, cloud storage, everything here will be automated. Then we are suggesting to use ESI integration systems.

So just not to lose the all commands in email. So we can use several, let's say, solutions that we have on the market.

We can speak about them later. So we can automate here signature status tracking, doing some signature status tracking, reminders, system storage, the entire process under control.

So, and of course. So, You We don't need any more Excel files. The system automatically creates agents in entire master, manage stable hierarchy, and supports bulk operations, and maintains complete audit logs of all changes we can provide here.

Then, correct me if I'm wrong, we go into licensing required. So here are some options, yes or no. As we understood, sometimes it's not required.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but if yes, we can. Okay, good.

[@5:42](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=342.9) \- **Eric Shaver (Plateau Group)**

So it's optional.

[@5:44](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=344.38) \- **Akop Vardanian**

And licensing is performed only when necessary for specific agents. Automated letters instead of thousands of manual ones, mail validations, no printing and mailing anymore.

So. Then platform integration, in case when certificates available, we go through the whole flow, you can see here, so we can just, here we automatic worksheet creation, we can have here calculation testing, external platform integration, all data is transferred and validates automatically here.

And final step, after receiving the first report, the system automatically configures all plans, commissions, rates, and activate the agent, no manual table operations.

And of course, exception handling, as we have at the moment, is a process in case of we need to handle some mismatches or premium calculations error, etc.

So, here I just present you. Do some five main steps of automation. Is that correct? Everything is okay and you've got everything.

I don't know. Am I clear, guys, here? Or do need to repeat me something?

[@7:19](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=439.104) \- **Eric Shaver (Plateau Group)**

That flow is a very good spot to start. How about that? There's some tweaks I see that are there.

But you're in the right thought process. And then slow down right there just a second. The reinsurance and retro setups got added.

That was some things I'd have reviewed with the agent services team, exceptions handling.

[@7:49](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=469.524) \- **Akop Vardanian**

Just to clarify some little things. We're not sure about the parallel in this process. Is that correct? Is it really works like this?

don't know. we're all out. After operation claims, like configure plans, then we go to platform integration and exception handling.

This is like two ways that we're going at the same time.

[@8:14](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=494.136) \- **Eric Shaver (Plateau Group)**

Well, the operations and claims and platform handling is a separate project that we're already working on. I'm not sure what that one's called.

Actually, I don't think we've given that into it. Michael, if we've given the, or is that still in Ammon's court for the modernization of the front end?

What are we trying to like? The operations and claims pieces there are separate from agent services and setup and all the pieces there.

But exception handling down to the bottom, yes, that is after the business has been processed and the exceptions come in.

If there are exceptions. Then those get pushed back to agent services to review and update either the outside system, the platform integration, or update our system to match, whichever it is.

But, yeah, I think this flow looks good from top to bottom. Okay, got it.

[@9:18](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=558.348) \- **Akop Vardanian**

Thank you.

[@9:19](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=559.348) \- **Eric Shaver (Plateau Group)**

I would also say that some of it is, you know, can be parallel in as it happens. Reviewing the forms, that happens first.

But when you get the operations team and verifying commissions and those, this may be split so that licensing or right below the senior officer, licensing starts happening at the same time the agent services system is being set up.

So it may be not a direct flow from, yeah, the licensing may get pushed back up a little bit because we have to have them licensed before they can start working.

[@9:56](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=596.588) \- **Aleksandr Nasstrom**

But nonetheless, yes, it's very close.

[@10:00](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=600.32) \- **Eric Shaver (Plateau Group)**

We can take this and review and go through it with the agent services team again and make sure they're thinking exactly the same way.

[@10:12](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=612.08) \- **Aleksandr Nasstrom**

Okay, yeah, it will be good to know when we can do some parallel things at the same time. Because from my perspective, now, I think I thought that it's go only after, let's say, so let's say we just signed some things with the agent.

Only after that, we can do some listens. We can go to the licensing process. Yeah, I agree. It would be after the signing with the agent, but then licensing sends out, I need all the information for the people that need to be licensed, that agent services start setting up the system.

Those two can work in parallel because they're not integrated together. The licensing system does the control of the first two pieces already done and automating the annual.

Letters is the next piece that needs to happen within licensing. Okay. Okay, I see. Yeah, thank you. Thank you for that clarifications.

Any questions here or we can move to more technical details and solution? No, think this is good. Okay, Alex.

[@11:30](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=690.492) \- **Michael Arsov (Plateau Group)**

Just a question. So we're going to have a review of this workflow again, right? I think when I'm going come as well and just kind of see, like Eric said, parallel activities, possible other automations, points.

[@11:43](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=703.292) \- **Aleksandr Nasstrom**

Yeah.

[@11:44](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=704.532) \- **Eric Shaver (Plateau Group)**

Yeah, and we'll bring Terry and Aaron in on this too so that we can talk about how each piece flows.

They're the ones that actually do the work, right? And maybe Kelly as well because Kelly is the one who's currently creating contracts.

And as we get moving forward forward with our new... new... Shelly and Shannon may very well want to be involved as well.

They need to understand it, but is there something that they need that we're not thinking about here? So if we go to sign way up, hopefully this is done before we get to this point.

But if it's a new product, then there may have to be filings done as well. So it may, before we get to this point, there's our original check.

Do we have this filing in place so that we can actually write this business?

[@12:38](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=758.264) \- **Akop Vardanian**

By the way, from the law perspective, is it possible to integrate design system process in the current one you have?

[@12:50](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=770.684) \- **Eric Shaver (Plateau Group)**

We have a product called Write Signature, and Ammon has already worked with the APIs for that to automate that process.

see You So, yeah, I think so. It's allowed. Okay. Okay, good.

[@13:06](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=786.856) \- **Akop Vardanian**

So I think I can send this schema after the call, right? So you can take a look and give us some feedback on that.

We can just restructure it. I think we are good here. I think so, too.

[@13:27](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=807.336) \- **Eric Shaver (Plateau Group)**

That's a very good layout. Is most of it from when Ivan was here? Was that Ivan's notes from his visit?

Yeah, it was about the main input.

[@13:39](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=819.856) \- **Yuliya Fortsel (Symfa)**

And then the call with the terror. Okay, good. That was very good.

[@13:45](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=825.676) \- **Eric Shaver (Plateau Group)**

Very good layout. Let's move on to the technical stuff, then.

[@13:52](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=832.016) \- **Yuliya Fortsel (Symfa)**

Alex? Yeah, thank you.

[@13:55](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=835.736) \- **Aleksandr Nasstrom**

Correct me if I'm wrong. I understand you are not against an agent. Portal, right? Because from our perspective, it's the most easiest way to connect agent with your system without manual work, manual filling, PDFs, and other docs.

Yeah, we already have a customer agent facing portal.

[@14:22](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=862.908) \- **Eric Shaver (Plateau Group)**

So we'll write this as an additional module that can flow right into it.

[@14:29](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=869.628) \- **Aleksandr Nasstrom**

Okay, what about the security part of this, like, public module? Because everything in your system... Okay, I mean, is it open in the internet?

Or is it closed inside your...

[@14:45](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=885.368) \- **Eric Shaver (Plateau Group)**

It's open to the internet, but it's behind two-factor authentication with Okta.

[@14:53](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=893.988) \- **Aleksandr Nasstrom**

Okay, it's okay, but what about the... That's great. Your, like, front-end... you. you. Closed via SSO or 2FA, but what about API?

Do you have some kind of API gateway or something like that to protect your back-end site or your infrastructure things?

Yes, all of that is with internal APIs.

[@15:22](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=922.48) \- **Eric Shaver (Plateau Group)**

So let me pull up the – yeah, let me pull up the website right quick, and you can see what we're – what I'm talking about.

Maybe.

[@15:34](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=934.94) \- **Brannon Smith**

Alex, are you thinking of, like, DDoS attacks or something else? Okay.

[@15:41](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=941.9) \- **Eric Shaver (Plateau Group)**

It's – those are all – it's all behind firewalls and, you know, application firewalls as well. Yeah, it's – it's fully secured.

[@15:51](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=951.74) \- **Aleksandr Nasstrom**

Okay. That's secure as you can be. Let me share my screen. Okay, let me share my screen. Okay. It's like high-level overview, do you see my screen sharing?

Yes. Yes.

[@16:10](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=970.612) \- **Yuliya Fortsel (Symfa)**

Okay, perfect.

[@16:12](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=972.212) \- **Aleksandr Nasstrom**

This is like a high-level overview, like future infrastructure, just simple modules. I can show maybe step-by-step how it looks like and how it, like, interacts.

As Akop mentioned, Agent Portal is a digital interface where agents will be able to fill the form, and even if you change the form in the future, everything will be updated automatically.

You don't need to, like, think about versions of files or something else. Then, of course, we will be able to validate all required fills before the agent submits this form.

you. Thank you. Then this portal will be able to upload required documents and if operational portal will need some clarifications or changes, we will be able to send notification directly into this portal and notify agent that we need some changes in this request.

I think why I ask about like security part here, as you can see, I put some kind of API gateway.

It's like security layer to protect your internal system from attacks outside of the internet.

[@17:51](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=1071.78) \- **Eric Shaver (Plateau Group)**

We have DMZ, full DMZ separation, and then we have APIs between production and DMZ that transfer. Perfect. Perfect.

[@18:02](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=1082.78) \- **Aleksandr Nasstrom**

I think we can reuse your entire system. And in this case, this API gateway, it's your DMZ, I think.

We can process authentication process, like navigate between different services inside your internal system. And of course, like setup rate limits or something else.

Of course, it depends on how much agents will work like at the same time with your system. can like upscale this part.

Okay. What else? Well, the operational portal, it's like agent management portal. It will be like separate part of the application.

We didn't decide it yet about the framework or tool we will be able to use in the This part, I wanted to talk about this later.

We have experience with no-code framework like OutSystems, because it's much easier to generate tables, simple dashboards, interact with the database without API if it's needed.

Because, of course, we can do it on React, but it's a little bit more, not harder, but we need more time to develop the same tables and features without system already outside the box.

Our framework right now is all C-Sharp and Blazor.

[@19:51](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=1191.07) \- **Eric Shaver (Plateau Group)**

Okay. the website that this will plug into is all fully C-Sharp and Blazor now with a Microsoft SQL backend.

Mm-hmm.-hmm. So when Amon comes back, he can explain some of that to you. Of course, we'd love to keep the code consistent using C-Sharp and Blazor so that when we have to, for maintenance purposes, right, we don't have to have an additional developer learning something new.

[@20:18](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=1218.36) \- **Aleksandr Nasstrom**

Okay, absolutely agree. Okay, Blazor, it was like our second thing to propose. But what do you think about UIKit for the app?

Because it will have different applications, different repositories. It will be much easier to have your own UIKit and just reuse components, styles, and everything else.

What do you think about that? Well, like I said, once Amon's back next week, he can explain exactly how he's done it.

It's all modular already.

[@20:59](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=1259.3) \- **Eric Shaver (Plateau Group)**

Lots of reusable modules. Jules, that are available. Actually, if I can get logged in, I'll show it to you.

[@21:08](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=1268.13) \- **Aleksandr Nasstrom**

I think I have already seen your interface, and I understand how it looks like. Okay. But we didn't know about, like, in details, if you already have some, like, styles and components.

If you have, much simpler for us to develop, not from scratch, just reuse. Your Components. Okay. As we understand, this operational portal will be handled, like, will allow users to work with different roles.

For example, Agent Manager, Senior Officer, and Licensing Manager. All of them will be able to log into the same portal, and depends on their roles, they will see different information information and text.

So you think you've seen the dashboard that we have on our website? I think Yuliya shared with me some screenshots with cards, like agent portal, like black layout with header and some cards.

[@22:19](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=1339.52) \- **Yuliya Fortsel (Symfa)**

Yeah, it was presented by Amon on our first meeting, but maybe you could share and add some other details, because it was the first meeting and we didn't ask any questions.

Understand.

[@22:34](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=1354.88) \- **Eric Shaver (Plateau Group)**

Let me share right quick then. Yeah, this would be great. Maybe. There we go. All right. Can you see it?

And is it large enough? Yeah, you see it. So one of the things, so it is all cards, but under user management, user management, every user has individual.

Let's Individual roles set over here on the left, and we currently have those based on the individual modules, so this person can only see EWIN loan forms and report remittance, where when you go back to mine, I've got a whole bunch.

And all of those are, all of this is behind Okta and Single Sign-On onto our website, so each of our individual users, both internal and external, can see only what they need to see.

But the biggest is, you know, once you go into, well, let's go into Certificate Search. No, let's don't do that one.

That takes too long. Yeah, that works. I'll do that. So, we actually have... So, we So, as you see, all of this is pre-populated down from our internal to external, removing a lot of the personal information.

So, you know, social security number's not there, and date of birth is not there, and all of those things.

At the time, I guess I was 40 for that one. But all of these are controlled within a single project, and your code will roll into this as well.

So, whoever it is, the CRM, for instance, that will actually deprecate, but the CRM is only available to our internal sales team.

And, you know, those things, and we can tile that down. And all of it is APIs back and forth between the database and the front end.

Okay. I'm interested.

[@24:58](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=1498.27) \- **Aleksandr Nasstrom**

But, yes, we can have roles within the different projects, too.

[@25:00](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=1500.8) \- **Eric Shaver (Plateau Group)**

Which one of the different ones has roles within the, so cert lookup as an employee or whatever, I have more role capabilities than an agent in the field does.

Okay. It's pretty clear.

[@25:15](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=1515.76) \- **Aleksandr Nasstrom**

I think it's, we're on the same page with that. Yeah. Okay. As you can see inside the operational portal, we just have three different blocks with different functionality in it.

Agent management, as we, as Akop, like, described, handles just agent creation and management process. In this module, we will be able to see and manage, like, agent entities, see the status, drill deep into the entity and see, for example, reports and other information, send requests, send needed, and, like, work with, with data.

together. Thank A senior officer module designed for final verification and approval when we just get the entity and if it's entity verified, senior officer will receive the notification and review the documents and information he needs and then send approve, send us approve.

Licensing module, it's like manager's agent licensing. We didn't touch this process in detail, but after Terry's call, we just understand it a little bit, but I add this module here as well.

That module is already built, except for the emailing of renewal licensing, so we can pull that out and plug that in as well.

Okay, and interface, I think, or you already have an interface as Already have a web-based interface, yes. Okay, perfect.

We can integrate this interface into operation module if you want. If not, we can leave it like a separate interface.

We'll see how Hammond feels about that next week.

[@27:27](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=1647.76) \- **Eric Shaver (Plateau Group)**

What his thoughts are. Okay.

[@27:30](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=1650.86) \- **Aleksandr Nasstrom**

Our system, it's our, like, backend for that, for this web application. Here will be, like, database layer, like, audit trail layer, where we'll track any operation with the entities.

Notification layer, where we'll be able to use email service or, like, web push notifications. It's not, like, to implement the pushes.

Well, and data validation logic, because when we receive the form, we have to validate all fields. Of course, some things we're not be able to validate automatically, for example, like compliance documents and the rest.

But basic fields, for example, like maybe calculations or something else, we will be able to process automatically. And that will be done in this data validation module.

And business logic, it's everything about like calculations, like different formulas, and the rest. As you can see, SQL Server Connection, it just present that we will be able to connect our core system into your database and receive an update data.

And external services, as I mentioned, as email service, of course. Right. things, as And data fingertips, as those an aspect of销ice.

I don't really know right now if we need to just send messages or receive as well and process all this message because in that case we need not just SMTP.

We have to implement real email server, which will process internal and external messages in that system. Then the e-sign and document storage.

About the document storage is like separate thing because as I understand right now you have like document templates and different like master policy and the rest documents inside like your local infrastructure.

And if we want to automate everything inside this. The web form, we have to process all these documents somewhere in the cloud, for example, Microsoft SharePoint or S3, and then reuse these templates and documents inside the system.

We have multiple document storage.

use Citrix, well, it's a progress share file for external purposes, which has the eSign capabilities built into it. So that may be the best answer for that.

But we can, as we get into more details of running this out, we can figure that out. Okay.

[@30:42](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=1842.16) \- **Aleksandr Nasstrom**

I'm asking because we just need to get access for these documents from our system. No, understand, but like I said, until Ammon can look through this and say, okay, this will work that wall.

[@30:55](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=1855.64) \- **Eric Shaver (Plateau Group)**

I've already built this.

[@30:56](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=1856.54) \- **Aleksandr Nasstrom**

I've already built that.

[@30:57](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=1857.62) \- **Eric Shaver (Plateau Group)**

That's kind of a, we have good. A good overview, but we can't go much further than that until Evan looks and see what he's already written.

Yeah, absolutely understand.

[@31:08](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=1868.59) \- **Aleksandr Nasstrom**

As I mentioned, it's our just like high level overview. It's not the final decision. It's just how we understand the system and how we like propose to build this system.

Of course, if you already have some like modules already developed, we don't need to like redevelop them. We will try to reuse everything you already have or maybe upgrade.

That's the case. Okay, I have a couple of more like technical questions. I don't really know if I need to ask right now or maybe I can send all of them via email and Amon can like take a look later and answer.

What's the best for you?

[@32:01](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=1921.02) \- **Eric Shaver (Plateau Group)**

Yeah, think send those via email so that we have time to talk about them and he can answer it with what he knows more technical, because he is the technical part of this, the real technical part of it.

Okay.

[@32:17](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=1937.38) \- **Yuliya Fortsel (Symfa)**

Okay, so I think that, as I remember, Amon is back on Monday, and we stopped, I called him to go through all this stuff one more time and to make sure.

As well as the other stuff, right? Okay, and yeah, anyway, we will, Eric, send you the first diagram that Akop demonstrated to review with the agent services team.

Okay, and one more question from my side. Do you have the internal deadline for this project?

[@32:52](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=1972.16) \- **Michael Arsov (Plateau Group)**

I mean, all of these projects, at least the first four ones we picked up are, you know, to be completed over the next month.

So my deadline is like, you know, like this week, so we need to, that's why we need to review and see like, okay, realistically, how do we break down this work and how long would it take, right?

So as we are evaluating each of these projects, we're going to be adjusting slightly the timeline. We need to maybe, as we complete these four projects, we sit down and we look at the overall timeline and the rest of the projects that in the pipeline, and then kind of try to see like, how do we push the rest of them to kind of reach that deadline of Q2 of next year.

Well, phase one actually should be, you know, sometime in, I guess, Q1, depending. We have other stuff that needs to be done by Q2, but this one should be done by Q1.

So for the next two and a half, three months, yeah. Okay. I don't know, might be too optimistic, but yeah, we gotta, we gotta kind of sit down and look at it.

[@34:01](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=2041.81) \- **Eric Shaver (Plateau Group)**

Yeah.

[@34:03](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=2043.33) \- **Yuliya Fortsel (Symfa)**

You have a goal and you need to create a plan to achieve this goal. Okay. So maybe any questions?

Yeah, I have one more question. Yeah.

[@34:14](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=2054.77) \- **Aleksandr Nasstrom**

I remember one thing I want to clarify, maybe Eric can help me with that, about like receiving reports from agent, monthly report or yearly report.

Do you think is it a good idea to develop like this report system in the MVP phase or we can do it later?

I mean, processing will be later, but that's a, yeah, that's a totally separate thing.

[@34:44](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=2084.27) \- **Eric Shaver (Plateau Group)**

This is, this is really the setting up of the agent and getting ready to process the business. And then that will be a totally separate project that's already probably 90% complete.

That we've been working on internally.

[@34:57](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=2097.41) \- **Aleksandr Nasstrom**

Okay. Okay. As I understand. The main goal for us right now is like this agent portal where we'll be able to automate this document processing phase and the most things you already developed.

We just need to understand what exactly you already built and how to rebuild these blocks. Okay, perfect.

[@35:32](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=2132.16) \- **Yuliya Fortsel (Symfa)**

And one little thing from my side, sorry, sorry, guys, I just have to say that.

[@35:37](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=2137.66) \- **Akop Vardanian**

So once we address you all the schemas, please, can you highlight us on which step, which systems to use?

So just to be aligned with just Alex said. So, okay, just to understand what kind of system do you already have?

It will help us to understand on which step. Which system we use through the whole process flow.

[@36:04](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=2164.19) \- **Eric Shaver (Plateau Group)**

Yeah, thank you. Sure, sure, sure. Okay.

[@36:08](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=2168.75) \- **Yuliya Fortsel (Symfa)**

Very good. Yeah, yeah, that's it for today. Thank you very much one more time for a lot of calls today.

Yeah, and have a good rest of your day. Thank you. See you. Bye. There's not more calls.

[@36:23](https://fathom.video/share/bJ1czxqJZdcDbZG657sg7b3rSnjrHU_p?timestamp=2183.15) \- **Brannon Smith**

Have good day. you. Not for tomorrow.
