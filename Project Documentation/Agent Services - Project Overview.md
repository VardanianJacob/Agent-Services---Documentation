```

## üõ† Technical Architecture (Current)

### **Legacy Agent Services System:**
- **Database:** Microsoft Access (30-year-old legacy system)
- **Interface:** Access forms (legacy UI)
- **Data Storage:** Normal relational database accessed through old forms
- **Authentication:** Basic Access security

### **Key Database Tables:**
- **EntityMaster:** Stores all account information
- **AgentSetupDirect:** Indicates which plans an agent can sell
- **AgentSetupMasterCredit:** Links agents and plans to commission/reinsurance tables
- **AgentSetupValuesCredit:** Detailed values for different durations (0-100 years)

### **Current Limitations:**
- No modern web interface for Agent Services
- Manual data entry and tracking
- Limited search capabilities
- No automated workflows
- Legacy VBA code mixed with SQL stored procedures
- **Disconnected from PLATEAU:** Agent Services runs separately from main system

## üéØ Project Goals (To-Be) 

### **Primary Objectives (From Internal Sync):**
1. **Eliminate Manual Excel Copy-Paste:** Replace Terry's manual Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V operations with automated C# operations
2. **Automate Complex Table Relationships:** Handle EntityMaster ‚Üí AgentSetupDirect ‚Üí MasterCredit ‚Üí ValuesCredit relationships automatically
3. **Add Comprehensive Audit Logging:** Track all changes at EntityMaster level (agreed approach by team)
4. **Create Hierarchical Navigation:** Drill-down interface from EntityMaster to related tables
5. **Integrate with PLATEAU:** Build Agent Services as module within existing PLATEAU system
6. **Maintain Database Structure:** Keep existing table relationships, automate operations through C# code

## üìä Process Metrics

### **Current Performance:**
- **Setup Time:** 30 minutes (simple) to 1 hour (complex)
- **Error Rate:** Manual process prone to human error
- **Volume:** Multiple agents setup per day
- **Dependencies:** Operations and Claims depend on Agent Services setup

### **Success Criteria:**
