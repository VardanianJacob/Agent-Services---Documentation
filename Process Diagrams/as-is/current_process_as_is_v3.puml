  :Prepare/Update Master Policies;
  :Prepare/Update Producer Agreement;
  :Email agreements for signature /\nreceive signed docs;
  :Create Agent in Access – Entity Master;
  :Manual Tracking in Excel;
  note right
    PAIN POINT: Manual Excel Tracking
    • Duplicate data entry after Access
    • Manual Excel tabs for tracking
    • Date/action logging by hand
    • No automation between systems
    • 10-15 min extra per agent setup
  end note

  note right
    PAIN POINT: Manual Licensing Letters
    • Thousands of letters per year
    • Manual printing and mailing
    • Outdated email addresses
    • Heavy manual work in January
    • Significant printing costs
  end note

' -------------------- PLATFORM INTEGRATION (AFTER LICENSING COMPLETE) --------------------
partition "Platform Integration" {
  note right
    Platform Integration happens AFTER
    licensing is complete (agent must be
    licensed before they can start working)
  end note

    :Request Certificate from Platform;
  else (NO)

note right
  Operations & Claims is a SEPARATE PROJECT
  (not part of Agent Services setup)
end note

' -------------------- EXCEPTION HANDLING (AFTER BUSINESS PROCESSING) --------------------
partition "Exception Handling" {
  note right
    Exception handling occurs AFTER
    business has been processed
    and exceptions come in
  end note
