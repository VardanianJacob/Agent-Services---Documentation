# Agent Services - Project Overview

## üìã Project Summary

**Project Name:** Agent Services Automation  
**Objective:** Replace legacy Microsoft Access system with modern web interface for agent management and setup processes  
**Current Status:** MVP Scope Clarification Complete  
**Technology Stack:** C# + Blazor (PLATEAU Integration)  
**Timeline:** Q1 2025 (2.5-3 months)  

## üè¢ Business Context

### What is Agent Services?
Agent Services is a department responsible for setting up and managing agents (financial institutions, banks, credit unions) who sell insurance products for the company. These agents are the individual locations that sell insurance products tied to financial transactions (loans, mortgages, etc.).

### Business Model
- **Insurance Type:** Credit insurance primarily
- **Products:** Life, disability, property, auto, and other insurance products tied to financial transactions
- **Premium Structure:** Mostly single premium policies (3 months to 10+ years terms)
- **Agents:** Banks, credit unions, dealerships, finance companies

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture 

### **Existing Infrastructure:**
- **PLATEAU System:** Modern web-based operational system with modular architecture
- **Technology Stack:** C# and Blazor framework with Microsoft SQL backend
- **Agent Portal:** Existing customer-facing portal with Okta 2FA authentication
- **Security:** DMZ separation, API Gateway, application firewalls
- **Document Management:** Citrix ShareFile with E-Sign capabilities

### **Integration Approach:**
- **Not Greenfield:** Agent Services will be built as a new module within existing PLATEAU system
- **Code Consistency:** Maintain C# and Blazor for maintenance purposes
- **UI Kit:** Leverage existing PLATEAU components and styling
- **Role-Based Access:** Individual user roles managed through Okta SSO
- **Modular Design:** Reusable components across different projects

### **Key Technical Decisions:**
- **Framework:** C# and Blazor
- **Authentication:** Okta with two-factor authentication
- **Database:** Microsoft SQL Server (existing)
- **E-Sign:** Citrix ShareFile integration (existing capability)
- **API Security:** Internal APIs with DMZ protection

### **Current System Integration:**
```
PLATEAU (Web System) ‚Üê‚Üí Access (Legacy Agent Services)
```

## üõ† Technical Architecture (Current)

### **Legacy Agent Services System:**
- **Database:** Microsoft Access (30-year-old legacy system)
- **Interface:** Access forms (legacy UI)
- **Data Storage:** Normal relational database accessed through old forms
- **Authentication:** Basic Access security

### **Key Database Tables:**
- **EntityMaster:** Stores all account information
- **AgentSetupDirect:** Indicates which plans an agent can sell
- **AgentSetupMasterCredit:** Links agents and plans to commission/reinsurance tables
- **AgentSetupValuesCredit:** Detailed values for different durations (0-100 years)

### **Current Limitations:**
- No modern web interface for Agent Services
- Manual data entry and tracking
- Limited search capabilities
- No automated workflows
- Legacy VBA code mixed with SQL stored procedures
- **Disconnected from PLATEAU:** Agent Services runs separately from main system

## üéØ Target Process (To-Be)

### **Target Process Flow Diagram:**
![To-Be Process](agent_services_to_be.svg)
*To-Be process with PLATEAU System (C#/Blazor), Agent Portal with Okta 2FA, Citrix ShareFile E-Sign, licensing starts RIGHT BELOW Senior Officer approval and works in parallel with all processes, and clarified exception handling. Diagram shows complete automated workflow with 5 automation points, Operations Team verification, and optional licensing process.*
